# js-game

This is my first js project.

This is actueally a js game. 

The game rule:

Roll the dice and all the score will add in the "current" score. But if the dice will be one. You lost your current score, so before the
one you have to hold, then the current score will be the global score. This way you have to make 30 or more. And you will be the "WINNER"
